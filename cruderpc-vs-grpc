7:47 PM so with a crude "rpc" implementation in C (no TLS), i get to 172k ops/s on my laptop
7:48 just to get an upper bound
7:48 so using grpc with go is 8% of this performance figure
kostas
7:48 PM Are yesterday's numbers w/o TLS as well?
simon
7:49 PM no
7:50 these were go grpc with tls
7:52 i don't know whether it is worth to hack in gnutls to see a performance difference
simon
8:56 PM 83k ops/sec with gnutls anon
8:56 @kostas: happy? :slightly_smiling_face:

9:07 PM ouch
9:07 what is an op? still Bitcoin size? (edited)
simon
9:39 PM couple of bytes
9:39 not much
9:40 heh it dropped to 75k, probably because of thermal limiting
9:42 vukolic: the size doesn't impact things much
9:42 localhost bandwidth is not a problem
vukolic
9:46 PM so it is 1/latency of the thingy
9:47 but 75k vs 15k is a lot
simon
9:56 PM well, one is C without any magic dispatch system
simon
10:14 PM with streaming rpc: ~13k ops/sec
simon
10:20 PM 38k ops/sec with streaming without pbft
simon
10:26 PM so go+streaming grpc = 1/2 performance of C
10:26 which is fine
vukolic
11:37 PM ack (edited)
